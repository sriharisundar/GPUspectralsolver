TO DO:

1) Avoid calculation of the basis tensor on GPU, instead pass on from CPU
2) Modify the CPU functions to completely use pointers
3) Implement a reduction alogrithm for getting errors on card itself
4) Have compiler directives to choose between FFTW and clFFT, and CPU vs GPU so on

DONE:
1) Convert to use of Hermitian symmetry
2) ElasticFFT on GPU
